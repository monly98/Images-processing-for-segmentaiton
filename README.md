# Images-processing with OpenCV
This repository focuses on utilizing OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library, for various image processing tasks. OpenCV provides a wide range of functions and algorithms specifically designed for image processing, making it a powerful tool for developing image processing applications such as object detection, image smoothing image segmentation and more.

# Image processing with Smoothing filters
Image filters play a vital role in various image processing tasks, such as noise reduction, feature enhancement, and image restoration. This repository provides efficient implementations of popular filters that can be easily integrated into your own projects.
# Filters
# Median Filter
The median filter is a nonlinear filter that replaces each pixel in an image with the median value of its neighboring pixels. It is effective in reducing impulse noise or salt-and-pepper noise, preserving edges, and preserving fine details.

# Minimum Filter
The minimum filter, also known as erosion, replaces each pixel in an image with the minimum value of its neighboring pixels. It can be used for noise reduction, edge detection, and morphological operations.

# Maximum Filter
The maximum filter, also known as dilation, replaces each pixel in an image with the maximum value of its neighboring pixels. It can be used for noise reduction, edge detection, and morphological operations.

# Histogram Equalization
Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance the contrast and improve the overall appearance of an image. It redistributes the pixel intensities in an image to achieve a more balanced histogram, resulting in improved visual quality.
