# Images-processing with OpenCV
This project is an implementation of computer vision tasks using the OpenCV library. It includes various examples and applications that demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCV for image processing, object detection, and more.
# Image-processing for segmentaiton
This technique segments the input image into different regions based on color, texture, or other visual characteristics.
# Before and after examples:
# Befor

# Image processing for Edge detection
This technique detects and highlights objects of interest in the input image using diferent filters for example Laplacian, Sobel, Cany Filter and prewitt.
